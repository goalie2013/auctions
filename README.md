Real Estate Auction Data & Mapping

This is a sample that got me on a project at a real estate company. I cannot show all of my work because of what was used for the proprietary software, but this is a rough draft of what I made initially.

I used Flask to create a Rest API for a web application, and kept the frontend vanilla. I used Mapbox GL for map because of their generous free tier.

In my submitted project, I used selenium to scan through housing auction sites and put them in a database. I used cleaning techniques to eliminate those without addresses, etc. then geocoded the locations so I could put them on a map.
